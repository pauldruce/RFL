- [ ] Create some demo apps to showcase how to create and run a simple simulation with the new library
- [ ] Unit tests for:
  - [ ] Hamiltonian Class
  - [ ] Metropolis Class
  - [ ] Simulation -> likely an end-to-end test of some description.
    - Look into how we should test the random-ness. How do we set a seed for this in a way that we can use in testing.
- [ ]  Create an interface for the random number generator and wrap the gsl methods we use in a class.
- [ ] Transfer methods that can be made static in Action to more appropriate place
